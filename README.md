# Fullstack---Shoping-List
<h1> Fullstack Shoping List </h1>
<p>
This is my first full-stack web app build with Node.js, and MongoDB rendered in JSX. It is built with the MVC structure. Originally I built a Todo list, but since it is so much popular I changed it to a Shopping list with the idea that multiple persons can have one account and have one shopping list to add and use it.
In this project, I wanted to get familiar with the basics of backend development, how to build a database, and how to respond to user requests using node.js. Authentication is handeled with passport.js.
